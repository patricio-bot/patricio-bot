## Hi there! My name is Patricio ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Frontend Developer from Barcelona. I love creating things. Although I have to confess that I often break them to understand how they work to improve them. I'm passionate about writing code for user experience and in my spare time, I enjoy modelling 3D characters while listening to EBM.
